Braindecode
===========

Braindecode is an open-source Python toolbox for decoding raw electrophysiological brain
data with deep learning models. It includes dataset fetchers, data preprocessing and
visualization tools, as well as implementations of several deep learning
architectures and data augmentations for analysis of EEG, ECoG and MEG.

For neuroscientists who want to work with deep learning and
deep learning researchers who want to work with neurophysiological data.


Installation Braindecode
========================

1. Install pytorch from http://pytorch.org/ (you don't need to install torchvision).

2. Install `MOABB <https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb>`_ via pip (needed if you want to use MOABB datasets utilities):

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install moabb

3. Install latest release of braindecode via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install braindecode

alternatively, if you use conda, you could create a dedicated environment with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braindecode/braindecode/master/environment.yml
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate braindecode

alternatively, install the latest version of braindecode via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -U https://api.github.com/repos/braindecode/braindecode/zipball/master


Documentation
=============

Documentation is online under https://braindecode.org, both in the stable and dev versions.
