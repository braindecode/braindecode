Visualization

Good model understanding begins with two questions: what is it for, and how big is it? The figures below list both for each model:

     and the primary experimental paradigm (right).

We are continually expanding this collection and welcome contributions! If you have implemented a model relevant to EEG, EcoG, or MEG analysis, consider adding it to Braindecode.
If you also want to push some extra plot for some possible angle, we are open to *good* pull requests.
