    Rescales the parameter tensor by the inverse square root of the layer id.

    In the labram, this is used to rescale the output matrices

    self-attention module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param: :class:`torch.Tensor`
        tensor to be rescaled
    layer_id: int
        layer id in the neural network

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: torch.Tensor
        input tensor
    drop_prob : float, optional
        survival rate (i.e. probability of being kept), by default 0.0
    training : bool, optional
        whether the model is in training mode, by default False
    scale_by_keep : bool, optional
        whether to scale output by (1/keep_prob) during training, by default True

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        output tensor

    Notes from Ross Wightman:
    (when applied in main path of residual blocks)
    This is the same as the DropConnect impl I created for EfficientNet,
    etc. networks, however,
    the original name is misleading as 'Drop Connect' is a different form
    of dropout in a separate paper...
    See discussion: https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/issues/494#issuecomment-532968956
    ... I've opted for changing the layer and argument names to 'drop path'
    rather than mix DropConnect as a layer name and use
    'survival rate' as the argument.

    Generates a 1-dimensional Gaussian kernel based on the specified kernel
    size and standard deviation (sigma).
    This kernel is useful for Gaussian smoothing or filtering operations in
    image processing. The function calculates a range limit to ensure the kernel
    effectively covers the Gaussian distribution. It generates a tensor of
    specified size and type, filled with values distributed according to a
    Gaussian curve, normalized using a softmax function
    to ensure all weights sum to 1.
