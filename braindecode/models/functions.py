    Notes from Ross Wightman:
    (when applied in main path of residual blocks)
    This is the same as the DropConnect impl I created for EfficientNet,
    etc. networks, however,
    the original name is misleading as 'Drop Connect' is a different form
    of dropout in a separate paper...
    See discussion: https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/issues/494#issuecomment-532968956
    ... I've opted for changing the layer and argument names to 'drop path'
    rather than mix DropConnect as a layer name and use
    'survival rate' as the argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : torch.Tensor

    forward_fourier : bool, optional
        Determines the format of the input tensor.
        - If True, the input is in the forward Fourier domain.

    -------
