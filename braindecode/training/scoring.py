    ----------
    scoring : None, str, or callable (default=None)
      If None, use the ``score`` method of the model. If str, it
      should be a valid sklearn scorer (e.g. "f1", "accuracy"). If a

      should return a scalar. This works analogously to the
      ``scoring`` parameter in sklearn's ``GridSearchCV`` et al.
    lower_is_better : bool (default=True)
      Whether lower scores should be considered better or worse.
    name : str or None (default=None)
      If not an explicit string, tries to infer the name from the
      ``scoring`` argument.
    target_extractor : callable (default=to_numpy)
