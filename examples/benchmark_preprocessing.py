"""Benchmarking preprocessing with parallelization and serialization
====================================================================

In this example, we compare the execution time and memory requirements of
preprocessing data with the parallelization and serialization functionalities
available in :func:`braindecode.preprocessing.preprocess`.

We compare 4 cases:
1. Sequential, no serialization
2. Sequential, with serialization
3. Parallel, no serialization
4. Parallel, with serialization

Case 1 is the simplest approach, in which all recordings in a
:class:`braindecode.datasets.BaseConcatDataset` are preprocessed one after the
other. In this scenario, :func:`braindecode.preprocessing.preprocess` acts
inplace, which means memory usage will likely stay stable (depending on the
preprocessing operations) if recordings have been preloaded. However, two
potential issues arise when working with large datasets: (1) if recordings have
not been preloaded before preprocessing, `preprocess` will need to load them
and keep them in memory, in which case memory can become a bottleneck, and (2)
sequential preprocessing can take a considerable amount of time to run when
working with many recordings.

A solution to the first issue (memory usage) is to save the preprocessed data
to a file so it can be cleared from memory before moving on to the next
recording (case 2). The recordings can then be reloaded with `preload=False`
once they have all been saved to disk. This enables using the lazy loading
capabilities of :class:`braindecode.datasets.BaseConcatDataset` and avoids
potential memory bottlenecks. The downside is that the writing to disk can take
some time and of course requires disk space.

A solution to the second issue (slow preprocessing) is to parallelize the
preprocessing over multiple cores whenever possible (case 3). This can speed up
preprocessing significantly. However, this approach will increase memory usage
because of the way parallelization is implemented internally (with
`joblib`, copies of (part of) the data must be made when sending arguments to
parallel processes).

Finally, case 4 (combining parallelization and serialization) is likely to be
both fast and memory efficient. As shown in this example, this remains a
tradeoff though, and the selected configuration should depend on the size of
the dataset and the specific operations applied to the recordings.

# We see that parallel preprocessing without serialization (blue crosses) is
# faster than simple sequential processing (blue circles), however it uses
# significantly more memory.
#
# Combining parallel preprocessing and serialization (yellow crosses) reduces
# memory usage significantly, however it increases run time by a few seconds.
# Depending on available resources (e.g. limited memory), it might therefore be
# more advantageous to use both parallelization and serialization.
