Sleep staging on the Sleep Physionet dataset using Eldele2021
=============================================================

This tutorial shows how to train and test a sleep staging neural network with
Braindecode. We use the attention-based model from [1]_ with the time distributed approach of [2]_
to learn on sequences of EEG windows using the openly accessible Sleep Physionet dataset [3]_ [4]_.

#
# Loading
# ~~~~~~~
#
# First, we load the data using the
# :class:`braindecode.datasets.sleep_physionet.SleepPhysionet` class. We load
# two recordings from two different individuals: we will use the first one to
# train our network and the second one to evaluate performance (as in the `MNE`_
# sleep staging example).

# Extract windows

#
# We extract 30-s windows to be used in the classification task.

# Create sequence samplers
# ------------------------
#
# Following the time distributed approach of [2]_, we need to provide our
# neural network with sequences of windows, such that the embeddings of
# multiple consecutive windows can be concatenated and provided to a final
# classifier. We can achieve this by defining Sampler objects that return
# sequences of window indices.
# To simplify the example, we train the whole model end-to-end on sequences,
# rather than using the two-step approach of [2]_ (i.e. training the feature
# extractor on single windows, then freezing its weights and training the
# classifier).
#

from braindecode.samplers import SequenceSampler

n_windows = 3  # Sequences of 3 consecutive windows
n_windows_stride = 3  # Maximally overlapping sequences

train_sampler = SequenceSampler(train_set.get_metadata(), n_windows, n_windows_stride)

# Finally, since some sleep stages appear a lot more often than others (e.g.
# most of the night is spent in the N2 stage), the classes are imbalanced. To

# Training
# --------
#
# We can now train our network. :class:`braindecode.EEGClassifier` is a
# braindecode object that is responsible for managing the training of neural
# networks. It inherits from :class:`skorch.NeuralNetClassifier`, so the
# training logic is the same as in
# `Skorch <https://skorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.

######################################################################
# Plot results
# ------------
#
# We use the history stored by Skorch during training to plot the performance of
# the model throughout training. Specifically, we plot the loss and the balanced
# balanced accuracy for the training and validation sets.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Extract loss and balanced accuracy values for plotting from history object

# Finally, we also display the confusion matrix and classification report:
#

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

y_true = [valid_set[[i]][1][0] for i in range(len(valid_sampler))]
y_pred = clf.predict(valid_set)

print(confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred))

######################################################################
# The model was able to learn despite the low amount of data that was available
# (only two recordings in this example) and reached a balanced accuracy of
# about 43% in a 5-class classification task (chance-level = 20%) on held-out
# data over 10 epochs.
#
# .. note::
#    To further improve performance, the number of epochs should be increased.
#    It has been reduced here for faster run-time in document generation. In
#    testing, 10 epochs provided reasonable performance with around 89% balanced
#    accuracy on training data and around 43% on held out validation data.
#    Increasing the number of training recordings and optimizing the hyperparameters
#    will also help increase performance
