"""
Sleep staging on the Sleep Physionet dataset using U-Sleep network
==================================================================

.. note::
    Please take a look at the simpler sleep staging example
    :ref:`here <sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_sleep_staging.py>`
    before going through this example. The current example uses a more complex
    architecture and a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) approach.

This tutorial shows how to train and test a sleep staging neural network with
Braindecode. We adapt the U-Sleep approach of [1]_ to learn on sequences of EEG
windows using the openly accessible Sleep Physionet dataset [2]_ [3]_.

.. warning::
    The example is written to have a very short excecution time.
    This number of epochs is here too small and very few recordings are used.
    To obtain competitive results you need to use more data and more epochs.

# Loading and preprocessing the dataset
# -------------------------------------
#
# Loading
# ~~~~~~~
#
# First, we load the data using the
# :class:`braindecode.datasets.sleep_physionet.SleepPhysionet` class. We load
# two recordings from two different individuals: we will use the first one to
# train our network and the second one to evaluate performance (as in the `MNE`_
# sleep staging example).
#
# .. _MNE: https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/sample-datasets/plot_sleep.html

from braindecode.datasets import SleepPhysionet

crop = (0, 30 * 400)  # we only keep 400 windows of 30s to speed example
dataset = SleepPhysionet(
    subject_ids=subject_ids, recording_ids=[2], crop_wake_mins=30,
    crop=crop)


######################################################################
# Preprocessing
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Next, we preprocess the raw data. We scale each channel recording-wise to
# have zero median and unit interquartile range. We don't upsample to 128 Hz as
# done in [1]_ so that we keep the example as light as possible. No filtering
# is described in [1]_.

# Create sequence samplers
# ------------------------
#
# Following the sequence-to-sequence approach of [1]_, we need to provide our
# neural network with sequences of windows. We can achieve this by defining
# Sampler objects that return sequences of windows.
# Non-overlapping sequences of 35 windows are used in [1]_, however to limit
# the memory requirements for this example we use shorter sequences of 3
# windows.

from braindecode.samplers import SequenceSampler

n_windows = 3  # Sequences of 3 consecutive windows; originally 35 in paper
n_windows_stride = 3  # Non-overlapping sequences

valid_sampler = SequenceSampler(valid_set.get_metadata(), n_windows, n_windows_stride)

# Print number of examples per class
print(len(train_sampler))
print(len(valid_sampler))

# Finally, since some sleep stages appear a lot more often than others (e.g.
# most of the night is spent in the N2 stage), the classes are imbalanced. To
# avoid overfitting to the more frequent classes, we compute weights that we
# will provide to the loss function when training.

# you can set `cudnn_benchmark=False` in `set_random_seeds`
# or remove `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True`

# Training
# --------
#
# We can now train our network. :class:`braindecode.EEGClassifier` is a
# braindecode object that is responsible for managing the training of neural
# networks. It inherits from :class:`skorch.NeuralNetClassifier`, so the
# training logic is the same as in
# `Skorch <https://skorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.
#
# .. note::
#    We use different hyperparameters from [1]_, as these hyperparameters were
#    optimized on different datasets and with a different number of recordings.
#    Generally speaking, it is recommended to perform hyperparameter
#    optimization if reusing this code on a different dataset or with more
#    recordings.

# Our model was able to learn, as shown by the decreasing training and
# validation loss values, despite the low amount of data that was available
# (only two recordings in this example). To further improve performance, more
# recordings should be included in the training set, the model should be
# trained for more epochs and hyperparameters should be optimized.
